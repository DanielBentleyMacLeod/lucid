// Starflow telemetry cache.
/* 
A P4 program passes control to *Flow by generating a "monitor_pkt" event. 
This calls the "monitor_pkt" handler in this program (around line 75)
That handler may generate two other events: 
  1. GPV records to collection servers (the events short_record and long_record)
  2. A memory release event (free_block) that gets recirculated
